Sometimes things go off like a charm
Sometimes things turn around and do you harm
But if we stick around a little longer
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger

These nights been swallowing my days
I can feel my time just slipping away
But if we stick around a little longer
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger

Another day another dollar
What are we gonna learn tomorrow?

Another day another dollar
What are we gonna learn tomorrow?

It seems we're drifting on a plane
A rising tide beneath the flame
But if we keep our heads above the water
Our legs will only become stronger

If every moment was our last
A kind memory of the past
Would fade into the darkness
With the comfort of our courage

Another day another dollar
What are we gonna learn tomorrow?

Another day another dollar
What are we gonna learn tomorrow?
