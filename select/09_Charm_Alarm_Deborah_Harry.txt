Debbie Harry ft. Miss Guy
Charm Alarm

Debbie: I know where you been but where're you coming from?
I got eyes in the back of my head
Miss Guy: I'm drinking my drink of glamour and damage, seduction and
Piss elegance
Deb: Oh, you're a danity jewel hooked on a chain a souvenir of some other time
MG: What we don't rememebr just didn't happen There's a feeling at the base of my spine
Deb: The room is getting crowded and its getting worse
If you get much closer well, you could get hurt
You're getting closer and I'm getting warm
Setting of my charm alarm
Who set ringing my charm alarm
Both: Charm Alarm, my charm alarm, my charm alarm (2x)
Deb: Don't be looking at Medusa's head
She'll stone your bones and leave you dead
A little bit of blind man's bluff will pop up like a powder puff
MG: We're two cool numbers in the heat of the night
I've got it wrong
Do you got it right?
I'm breaking the glass
Got you in mind
Lets do it again
Both: Stop rewind
Deb: You're setting off my charm alarm
You're getting closer and I'm getting warm
Setting off my charm alarm
Who set ringing my charm alarm?
Both: Charm Alarm, my charm alarm, my charm alarm, (2x)
MG: I know where you been but where're you coming from?
I got eyes in the back of my head
Deb: I'm drinking my drink of glamour and damage, seduction and
Piss elegance
MG: Oh, you're a danity jewel hooked on a chain a souvenir of some other time
Deb: What we don't rememebr just didn't happen There's a feeling at the base of my spine
The room is getting crowded and it's get worse
If you get much closer well, you could get hurt
You're setting off my clarm alarm
Who set my charm alarm...
