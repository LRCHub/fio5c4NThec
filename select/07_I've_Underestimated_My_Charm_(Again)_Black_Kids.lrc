[00:00.33] Oh, like many a male,
[00:03.08] I get angst in my pants
[00:07.71] And goddamn it to hell,
[00:10.54] It don't help if I dance
[00:22.54] 
[00:14.92] And you, you're not doing too well
[00:18.22] All the blogs are about you, girl
[00:22.46] They caught you in the park after dark
[00:25.96] Giving head to a statue, girl
[00:29.65] Oh, cruel!
[00:34.65] 
[00:32.11] I didn't mean to do you no harm
[00:34.88] I just underestimated my charm
[00:39.22] And if I ever bother to tell you the truth, oh baby
[00:43.59] You're too much sugar for my sweet tooth, all right I
[01:10.09] 
[00:47.43] Didn't mean to do you no harm
[00:50.12] I just underestimated my charm
[00:54.17] And if I ever bother to tell you the truth, oh baby
[00:58.89] You're too much sugar for my sweet tooth, all right now
[01:26.39] 
[01:05.90] You're on your honeymoon
[01:08.71] And you're sending me notes
[01:13.62] You hope to see me soon,
[01:16.42] You've got "see" wrapped in quotes
[01:20.90] I used to find it funny to say,
[01:24.19] "What's your man got to do with me?"
[01:29.06] But then I saw him downtown,
[01:31.26] Placing bets on the hounds
[01:33.04] He was as big as a house!
[01:34.91] We can't be messin' around!
[01:48.41] 
[01:37.87] I didn't mean to do you no harm
[01:40.51] I just underestimated my charm
[01:44.52] And if I ever bother to tell you the truth, oh baby
[01:49.44] You're too much sugar for my sweet tooth, all right I
[02:15.94] 
[01:53.34] Didn't mean to do you no harm
[01:56.01] I just underestimated my charm
[02:00.15] And if I ever bother to tell you the truth, oh baby
[02:04.68] You're too much sugar for my...
[02:20.18] 
[02:23.03] Bom bom, bom bom, bom bom, bom bom
[02:27.66] Beep beep, beep beep, boooo
[02:32.75] Bom bom, bom bom, bom bom, bom bom
[02:37.49] Beep beep, beep beep, boooo
[02:40.62] (Repeat in background)
[02:51.62] 
[02:41.66] Oooh, every time we kiss,
[02:43.57] It's like an inside joke
[02:45.65] I always miss.
[02:46.76] Our love is like a tug-of-war
[02:48.90] Don't touch me girl,
[02:50.07] I can't hug no more!
[03:00.07] 
[02:51.53] Every time we kiss,
[02:53.00] It's like an inside joke
[02:54.87] I always miss.
[02:56.25] Our love is like a tug-of-war
[02:58.32] Don't touch me girl,
[02:59.50] I can't hug no more!
[03:09.50] 
[03:02.45] Whoa oh oh oh oh
[03:04.71] Whoa oh oh oh oh
[03:07.17] Whoa oh oh oh oh ohhh oh
[03:11.71] Whoa oh oh oh oh
[03:14.36] Whoa oh oh oh oh
[03:16.68] Whoa oh oh oh oh ohhh oh oh
